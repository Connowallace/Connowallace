- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Connor Wallace. I'm currently working to complete my BS in Computer Science. I'm hoping to begin work in software development after my graduation in March 2023.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in solving problems. Whether it's a user menu, a complex algorithm, or getting two pieces of software to talk to each other, I love to make things work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning VBA for a PowerPoint based map printing application at work. I'm currently learning Java Swing for a school project involving webpages.
